/*
Write a function called superbowlWin() that:
  Receives 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
  
  Each object has two properties: year and result
  
  Use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
  
  superbowlWin() should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!). If no
  
  win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined

*/

  {year: "2018", result: "L"},
  {year: "2017", result: "W"},
  {year: "2016", result: "N/A"},
  {year: "2019", result: "W"},
